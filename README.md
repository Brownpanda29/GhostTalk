# GhostTalk

GhostTalk is a secure and completely anonymous command-line chat application that uses AES-256 encryption to ensure the privacy of your conversations. This chat app doesn't require any user registration data apart from a chosen username, and the server doesn't save any user information.

## Features

- Strong AES-256 encryption for secure messaging.
- No registration required, just pick a username and start chatting.
- Completely anonymous; your data is not stored on the server.
- Real-time chat with multiple users.
- Command-line interface for simplicity.

## Future Plan: Adding a GUI

In the future, we plan to enhance GhostTalk by adding a graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI will provide a more user-friendly and visually appealing way to interact with the app. The GUI will retain the security and anonymity features that GhostTalk is known for while improving the overall user experience.
